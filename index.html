      <p>Moray has been responsible for spearheading several major changes to the product, including rearchitecting the entire data layer to increase performance (over 300x on some operations), and adding video conferencing features in response to the rise in remote working among customers. He has also improved the tooling and documentation around the application, adding CI and streamlining the deployment process.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>Macdonald Technology <span>Consultant</span></h3>
      <p class="date-range">August 2023 &ndash; Present, Wiltshire/Remote</p>
      <p>Alongside his long-term roles, Moray provides consulting and development services to a range of smaller clients and startups.</p>
      <p>This includes advising on technology and architecture choices, analysing market fit and advising on project planning. He is also involved with developing prototype systems and full MVPs (supported by the latest AI tools) to demonstrate both market and technology fit.</p>

      <h3>EduTech Client<span>Full Stack Developer</span></h3>
      <p class="date-range">January 2025 &ndash; April 2025, Remote</p>
      <p>A short term contract assisting a digital agency startup to migrate a legacy ASP.NET Web API to a modern GraphQL API written in Typescript and hosted on Azure, while keeping the same underlying SQL Server database. This was a complex task as data and audit trail integrity was a core requirement of the system, and the variant of SCD2 used by the data model made even simple operations very intricate.</p>

      <h3>Professional Services Client A<span>Cloud Architecture Consultant</span></h3>
      <p class="date-range">January 2024 &ndash; October 2024, Remote</p>
      <p>To accompany their move from MVC to React, this client was also looking to move their mature and successful B2B product to Azure. The customer was also keen to remove this giant system's dependency on a single on-premise SQL Server instance, which had become a performance bottleneck.</p>
      <p>Moray designed and prototyped a new event-driven architecture, making heavy use of Azure Service Bus distributing messages between microservices hosted in Azure Kubernetes Service as well as on-premise. In addition, the whole system was defined in Bicep which allowed the team to rapidly spin up and tear down test environments as needed.</p>

      <p>With pressure from customers at the start of a busy time for the company, Moray had to quickly switchs skillset from an API-driven React tech stack to Cat in a Flat's Python-based stack in order to quickly deliver value to the development team and their community of pet-sitting customers.</p>
      <p>As well as new development, Moray also supported the application hosting on AWS, and their mobile app, built with Cordova (Ionic).</p>

Moray was brought in to provide a series of React prototypes and boilerplate repositories displaying best practices to help their developers get started.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>Cat In A Flat<span>Full Stack Developer (contract)</span></h3>
      <p class="date-range">September 2023 &ndash; Present, Bristol/Remote</p>
      <p>Moray was brought in to support the existing development team developing new features for and supporting users of Cat in a Flat's pet sitting app.</p>
      <p>With pressure from customers at the start of a busy time for the company, Moray had to quickly pivot from an API-driven React tech stack to a new Python-based stack in order to quickly deliver value to the development team and their customers.</p>
      <p>As well as new development, Moray also supports the application hosting on AWS, and their mobile app, built with Cordova.</p>

      <h3>Digital Communities Ltd (formerly Groop)<span>Lead Developer</span></h3>
      <p class="date-range">September 2019 &ndash; Present, Corsham/Remote</p>
      <p>As their first internal developer, Moray is responsible for all technical aspects of the Groop people management product. Taking over from an external team, Moray had to quickly become familiar with the product&rsquo;s extensive features, codebase, hosting environment, companion mobile app, and a legacy version of the product.</p>
      <p>Moray swiftly built a small team of developers to support and expand the product, and put in place Agile processes in conjunction with the customer support and management teams to support development. He has also mentored junior developers.</p>
      <p>Moray has been responsible for spearheading several major changes to the product, including rearchitecting the entire data layer to increase performance (over 300x on some operations), and adding video conferencing features in response to the rise in remote working among customers. He has also improved the tooling and documentation around the application, adding CI and streamlining the deployment process.</p>
      <p>Moray also manages all aspects of the application hosting, system and database administration. He oversees penetration and load testing, and recently performed a complete migration of all 20 servers to AWS.</p>
